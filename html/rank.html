      <p align="justify">Carpe Noctem runs on a system of government by representation. If Specialists, Grunts or Recruits, also referred to as the "Community Player Base", would like to propose changes they can relay wishes / suggestions to their assigned JrNCO. It is the JrNCOs duty to speak on behalf of the Community Player Base at the next NCO meeting. The final decision on the direction the community takes is in the hands of the three voting members (SrNCOs) who have equal voting power. SrNCOs must place their voting decisions in the interest of all members and must confer with NCOs and JrNCOs in a monthly meeting <b><u>before</u></b> any major decision is made. JrNCOs should argue on behalf of the Community Player Base while SrNCOs represent the needs of management, meta gameplay & business. NCOs are meant to be the neutral tipping point on the scale.</p>

      <p align="justify">Being part of any branch helps turning the cogs that are running this community. You will have to be at least minimum rank of Grunt to apply for any of the branches. When applying for rank promotions we will consider your investment in branch work.</p>
