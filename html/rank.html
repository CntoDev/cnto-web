    </header>

      <p align="justify">Carpe Noctem runs on a system of government by representation. If Specialists, Grunts or Recruits (also referred to as the "community player base") would like to propose changes they can relay their withses to their assigned JrNCO. JrNCO will then bring these points on behalf of them in the next monthly NCO meeting. The final decision on the direction of the community takes is in the hands of three officer ranks, CO, XO and SCNO, who have equal voting power over each other. The officers must base their foting decisions in the interest of all members and must confer with the NCOs and JrNCOs in a monthly meeting <b><u>before</u></b> any major decision is made definitive. JrNCOs should argue on behalf of the community player base while the officers represent the needs of management, meta gameplay & business. NCOs are meant to be the neutral tipping point on the scale.</p>

      <p align="justify"><font color="b80000"><b>Please note that all donations, including the rank-dependent ones, are not reimbursable.</b></font> That includes reasons like long term LoAs, demotions or discharges on accound of undesirable behaviour as stated in our Rules & Regulations. Any surplus of donations can <b><u>only</u></b> be spent on investments towards the community: e.g. upgrading server hardware / software, elite armaclans.com membership, professional ar work & webdesign or other goodies like printing shirts and mailing them to members to celebrate anniversaries etc.</p>

      <p align="justify">Being part of any branch helps turning the cogs that are running this community. You will have to be at least the rank of Grunt to apply for any of the branches. When applying for rank promotions we will consider your investment in branch work.</p>

        <li>Gain access to monthly NCO meetings (Gold only)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Gold contributors gain access to the NCO meetings in order to observe what their funds are being spent and how decisions concerning the community are concluded. They are invited to be spectators during these meetings, however some topics will be marked by the meeting leader as "feedback sensitive". On these topics the NCOs will ask for opinions and ideas from present Contributors to get a feeling for the general mood of the community. Attendance to NCO meetings are not mandatory for Contributors, but we do require a response such as attending or "not attending" similar to regular events.</p>
